Purpose & context
Denys is developing comprehensive engineering frameworks and databases for magnetics components and power electronics design, with particular focus on transformer design methodologies. The work centers on creating systematic approaches to PSFB (Phase-Shifted Full-Bridge) transformer development following established industry methodologies like Michael O'Loughlin's UCC28950/UCC28951 framework. Success involves building reusable design tools, databases, and documentation that streamline the engineering process from component selection through final design verification. The domain requires deep knowledge of power electronics, magnetic component design, loss calculations, and thermal management across different rectification topologies.
Current state
Denys is actively building a magnetics component database architecture using Airtable as the primary relational database combined with GitHub for design artifacts and automation tools. The database structure includes linked tables for Cores, Materials, Wire, Bobbins, Manufacturers, and Design_Projects with calculated fields for key parameters like Ap (core area product). Automation workflows are being developed using Python scripts with Airtable API integration for web scraping manufacturer catalogs and parsing PDF datasheets. Simultaneously, comprehensive transformer design frameworks are being created as detailed artifacts covering complete calculation procedures, worked examples, and verification checklists for both synchronous rectification and SiC Schottky diode full-bridge rectifier configurations.
On the horizon
Implementation of the complete database system is planned as a 22-30 hour development effort with ongoing monthly maintenance. Future automation includes GitHub Actions for scheduled manufacturer catalog updates and real-time design integration where Python scripts query the database during transformer calculations to automatically select optimal cores based on requirements. The framework development will likely expand to cover additional topologies and design variations as the foundational PSFB methodology proves successful.
Key learnings & principles
Google Drive limitations became clear early in database planning - lack of relational queries, manual CSV updates, poor automation capabilities, and no programmatic API access make it unsuitable for technical component databases. The Airtable + GitHub architecture provides superior relational database capabilities while maintaining design artifact version control. For PSFB transformer design, diode rectification works optimally for output voltages ≥24V and currents ≤20A, with 4-9% efficiency penalties but significant cost and complexity advantages for low-volume applications. O'Loughlin's empirical 2× factor method for loss estimation provides practical engineering accuracy without excessive computational complexity.
Approach & patterns
Design work follows an iterative artifact-based workflow where initial frameworks are created as comprehensive downloadable markdown documents, then updated with manufacturer specifications, loss analysis, and optimization iterations. Each framework includes complete calculation trails, worked examples comparing different topologies, decision matrices, and practical verification checklists. Database development prioritizes automation and real-time integration, with Python scripts handling data validation, manufacturer catalog parsing, and design tool integration. The approach emphasizes creating professional-grade deliverables that serve as both working tools and documentation.
Tools & resources
Primary technical stack includes Airtable for relational component data with calculated fields and custom views, GitHub for version control of design artifacts and automation scripts, and Python with Airtable API for data processing and manufacturer catalog integration. PDF parsing utilizes tools like pdfplumber combined with Claude API for datasheet processing. Design methodologies reference established industry frameworks, particularly Michael O'Loughlin's UCC28950/UCC28951 600-W application notes for PSFB transformer design principles and calculation procedures.
